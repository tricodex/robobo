    It is advised to only use methods defined in this class when writing code,
    both for the hardware and for the simulation.

    A bunch of methods deal with "blocking", which is how to do simulatanious tasks.
    This is quite complex, and has differences between behavior of harware and simulation.

    To avoid this, never use a method that has a `blockid` perameter.
    All of these have sister methods that end in `_blocking` instead.
    This will prevent you from doing simulatanious tasks, but decrease complexity.
